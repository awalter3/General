This is the schematic design I was working on. Its incredibly rough and unfinished, and I am not even sure if I was setting up power to the chip correctly. I mainly started it out of excitement after programming the development board for a while, and then realizing that the chip used was cheap enough that it could be a good replacement for 16 bit atmel based hobby boards like arduino. After I finish building my current 3D printer which uses arduino based boards, This is what I plan on working on.
