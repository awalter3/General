These programs were written for the STM32L-DISCOVERY board, for an embedded systems class. The actual programs are fairly simple, but the point was to see how well you could read datasheets and find information. I really enjoyed programming this board, and really liked the ARM Cortex M3 processor. Because of this I started reading more datasheets, and designing a schematic using the same chip to try to replace the current arduino board used for most cheap 3D printers. Due to time constraints though, the schematic is very far from being finished.
